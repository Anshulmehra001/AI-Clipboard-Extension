# AI Clipboard Extension - Demo Script
## 3-Minute Video Presentation

### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Chrome browser with extension installed]**

"Hi! I'm excited to show you the AI Clipboard extension - my submission for the Chrome Built-in AI Challenge. This extension solves a problem we all face: rewriting the same content for different contexts.

How many times have you copied bullet points from notes and needed to turn them into a professional email? Or taken technical documentation and wanted to explain it casually to a friend? 

The AI Clipboard extension transforms your clipboard content instantly using Chrome's built-in AI APIs - all on-device, completely private, and lightning fast."

### Scenario 1: Professional Email Transformation (0:30 - 1:10)

**[Screen: Gmail compose window]**

"Let me show you how this works. I have some quick notes about a project update:"

**[Copy text: "project delayed, need more time, budget issues, will update next week"]**

"I need to send this to my manager as a professional email. Instead of rewriting it manually, I'll select some text in the email field, right-click, and choose 'AI Clipboard: Paste As... Make Professional.'"

**[Demonstrate right-click menu and selection]**

"Watch this - in less than two seconds, my casual notes become: 'I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the project timeline. We are experiencing some delays due to budget constraints and will require additional time to complete the deliverables. I will provide a comprehensive update next week with revised timelines.'"

**[Show transformed text appearing in email]**

"Notice how it maintained the key information but transformed the tone completely. This happened entirely on my device using Chrome's Rewriter API - no data sent anywhere."

### Scenario 2: Casual Message Conversion (1:10 - 1:50)

**[Screen: Slack or messaging app]**

"Now let's go the other direction. I have this formal announcement:"

**[Copy text: "Please be advised that the quarterly team meeting has been rescheduled to accommodate all stakeholders and will now take place on Friday at 2 PM in Conference Room B."]**

"I want to share this with my team in a more casual way. Right-click, select 'Make Friendly & Casual'..."

**[Demonstrate transformation]**

"And it becomes: 'Hey everyone! Just a heads up that we moved our quarterly team meeting to Friday at 2 PM in Conference Room B to work better for everyone's schedules.'"

**[Show result]**

"Same information, completely different tone. The AI understood the context and made it conversational while keeping all the important details."

### Scenario 3: Summary Creation (1:50 - 2:30)

**[Screen: Long article or document]**

"Finally, let's try summarization. I have this long article about AI developments..."

**[Copy several paragraphs of text about AI]**

"I want to share the key points quickly. Right-click, 'Paste as Summary (TL;DR)'..."

**[Demonstrate summarization]**

"And Chrome's Summarizer API gives me: 'TL;DR: Recent AI developments show significant progress in natural language processing and computer vision, with new models achieving better accuracy while requiring less computational power.'"

**[Show summary result]**

"Perfect for sharing the essence without overwhelming anyone with details."

### Key Benefits Highlight (2:30 - 2:50)

**[Screen: Extension overview or architecture diagram]**

"What makes this special? Three things:

**Speed** - Transformations happen in under 2 seconds because everything runs locally on Chrome's built-in AI.

**Privacy** - Your content never leaves your device. No API keys, no external servers, no data collection.

**Seamless Integration** - Works on any website with text input. Gmail, Slack, Google Docs, social media - anywhere you write."

### Closing (2:50 - 3:00)

**[Screen: Chrome Web Store or GitHub repository]**

"The AI Clipboard extension showcases the power of Chrome's built-in AI APIs to solve real productivity problems while keeping your data completely private. 

Thanks for watching, and I hope this makes your daily writing tasks a little bit easier!"
